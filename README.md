Chess Game

Building a basic two-player, turn-swapping Chess game (no chess engine) for two input players. This will include all the UI elements, logic and classes for playing a Chess game.
Written in C# for the back-end logic and AvaloniaUI to display the game, as a fun project to develop my skills.
